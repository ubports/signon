/*! \mainpage SignOn plugin development

@section intro Introduction

This library contains the interface definition and a few classes that should be
used when implementing an authentication plugin for the Single Sign On
framework.


@section usage Usage

Since it currently consists of a few header files and of a single moc-generated
.cpp file, the library is built statically.

The library ships with a pkg-config file (@a signon-plugins.pc) and with a
qmake configuration features file (@a signon-plugins.prf).


@section classlist List of classes in libsignon-qt

Here are the main classes in the libraries. You can also <a

AuthPluginInterface reside in the SignOn namespace.

<table>
  <tr><td>AuthPluginInterface</td><td>Interface to be implemented by all
authentication plugins.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>SignOn::UiSessionData</td><td>Dictionary of data to be exchanged
between the plugin and the SignOn UI.</td></tr>
</table>
